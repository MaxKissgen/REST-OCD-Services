OCD Test Project.

This project is a very first prototype for the implementation of a web service for overlapping community detection.

It is intended for experimenting only.

Configuration:
- in src/META-INF/persistence.xml:
	adapt the database configuration if necessary
	reset the value of the property eclipselink.ddl-generation to "create-tables"
